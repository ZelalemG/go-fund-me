# 'GO FUND ME' DApp (using Factory Design Pattern)

This repo is part of my tutorial demonestrating how to implement the concept of 
design patter for creation (clonning) of smart contracts using clone factory. 
You can learn more about what design pattern is and the benefits of contract 
factory design pattern in my blog.

This project is intended to be used as a learning reference for blockchain 
developers followoing the tutorial in my blog (http://zillo.one/blog/go-fund-me), but 
you should be able to follow it by yourself by reading the README and exploring its
`contracts`, `tests`, `scripts` and 'config' files and directories.

## Quick start

The first things you need to do are cloning this repository and installing its
dependencies:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ZelalemG/crypto-arbitrage.git
cd NFT-MINTING
npm install
```

Once installed, let's run Hardhat's testing network:

```sh
npx hardhat node
```

Then, on a new terminal, go to the repository's root folder and run this to
deploy your contract:

```sh
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
```

Finally, we can run the frontend with:

```sh
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) to see your Dapp. You will
need to have [Metamask](https://metamask.io) installed and listening to
`localhost 8545`.
